                The BDNF protein is encoded by a 
                gene that is also called BDNF, found 
                in humans on chromosome 11.[3][4] Structurally, 
                BDNF transcription is controlled by 8 different 
                promoters, each leading to different transcripts containing 
                one of the 8 untranslated 5’ promoter exons spliced to the 3’ 
                encoding exon. Promoter IV activity is strongly stimulated by c
                alcium and is primarily under the control of a Cre regulatory component, 
                suggesting a putative role for the transcription factor CREB and the source
                of BDNF’s activity-dependent effects .[26] There are multiple mechanisms through
                neuronal activity can increase BDNF exon IV specific expression.[26] Stimulus-mediated neuronal
                excitation can lead to NMDA receptor activation, triggering a calcium influx. Through a protein
                signaling cascade requiring Erk, CaM KII/IV, PI3K, and PLC, NMDA receptor activation is capable of
                triggering BDNF exon IV transcription. BDNF exon IV expression also seems capable of further stimulating
                its own expression through TrkB activation. BDNF is released from the post-synaptic membrane in an 
                activity-dependent manner, allowing it to act on local TrkB receptors and mediate effects that can leading to signaling cascades 
                also involving Erk and CaM KII/IV.[26][27] Both of these pathways probably involve calcium-mediated phosphorylation of CREB at 
                Ser133, thus allowing it to interact with BDNF’s Cre regulatory domain and upregulate transcription.[28] However, NMDA-mediated 
                receptor signaling is probably necessary to trigger the upregulation of BDNF exon IV expression because normally CREB interaction
                with CRE and the subsequent translation of the BDNF transcript is blocked by of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
                protein 2 (BHLHB2).[29] NMDA receptor activation triggers the release of the regulatory inhibitor, allowing for BDNF exon IV 
                upregulation to take place in response to the activity-initiated calcium influx.[29] Activation of Dopamine receptor D5 also 
                promotes expression of BDNF in prefrontal cortex neurons.
                NMDA receptor activity
                NMDA receptor activation is essential to producing the activity-dependent molecular changes involved in the formation of new memories.
                Following exposure to an enriched environment, BDNF and NR1 phosphorylation levels are upregulated simultaneously, probably because 
                BDNF is capable of phosphorylating NR1 subunits, in addition to its many other effects.[33][34] One of the primary ways BDNF can 
                modulate NMDA receptor activity is through.....can increase NMDA receptor activity through Fyn activation. 
                This has been shown to be important for processes such as spatial memory in the hippocampus, demonstrating the therapeutic and 
                functional relevance of BDNF-mediated NMDA receptor activation.[38]
                Synapse stability
                In addition to mediating transient effects on NMDAR activation to promote memory-related molecular changes, BDNF should also 
                initiate more stable effects that could be maintained in its absence and not depend on its expression for long term synaptic 
                support.[40] It was previously mentioned that AMPA receptor expression is essential to learning and memory formation, as these 
                are the components of the synapse that will communicate regularly and maintain the synapse structure and function long after the 
                initial activation of NMDA channels. BDNF is capable of increasing the mRNA expression of GluR1 and GluR2 through its interaction 
                with the TrkB receptor and promoting the synaptic localization of GluR1 via PKC- and CaMKII-mediated Ser-831 phosphorylation.[41]
                It also appears that BDNF is able to influence Gl1 activity through its effects on NMDA receptor activity.[42] BDNF significantly
                enhanced the activation of GluR1 through phosphorylation of tyrosine830, an effect that was abolished in either the presence of a 
                specific NR2B antagonist or a trk receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor.[42] Thus, it appears BDNF can upregulate the expression and 
                synaptic localization of AMPA receptors, as well as enhance their activity through its postsynaptic interactions with the NR2B 
                subunit. This suggests BDNF is not only capable of initiating synapse formation through its effects on NMDA receptor activity, 
                but it can also support the regular every-day signaling necessary for stable memory function.
            Enriched housing provides the opportunity for exercise and exposure to multimodal stimuli. The increased visual, physical, and 
            cognitive stimulation all translates into more neuronal activity and synaptic communication, which can produce structural or 
            molecular activity-dependent alterations.[53][54] Sensory inputs from environmental stimuli are initially processed by the cortex 
            before being transmitted to the hippocampus along an afferent pathway, suggesting the activity-mediated effects of enrichment can 
            be far-reaching within the brain.[54] BDNF expression is significantly enhanced by environmental enrichment and appears to be the 
            primary source of environmental enrichments ability to enhance cognitive processes. Environmental enrichment enhances synaptogenesis,
            dendridogenesis, and neurogenesis, leading to improved performance on various learning and memory tasks. BDNF mediates more pathways
            involved in these enrichment-induced processes than any other molecule and is strongly regulated by calcium activity making it 
            incredibly sensitive to neuronal activity.
